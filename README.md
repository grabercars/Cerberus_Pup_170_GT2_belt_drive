Cerberus Pup 170 Gt2 is an experimental 3D Delta Robot printer that uses traditional toothed belts. Please be aware that there will probably (and most likely) be significant changes and improvements made to this design.

A BOM is available here (IT IS OUTDATED!!! and needs corrections ASAP) - http://tinyurl.com/Pup-BOM-Google-Spreadsheet - there are still some issues with the BOM, please contact Steve Graber to help correct any issues you find.

You will need to make a set of effector rods with 3/8" balls attached to the ends. Make your own or these are available from Steve Graber - grabercars@gmail.com.


Notes:

All machined parts required to build Cerberus Pup are now all available for purchase at http://3d.grabercars.com. They are manufactured on a CNC lathe to very tight tolerances.

VERTICAL CARRIAGE DRIVE SYSTEM:
Requires GT2 belts and 20T (or 16T) pulleys. Each upper gt2 belt idler consists of 2x MR128ZZ bearing placed side-by-side. 6 bearings required per printer. The upper outer support bracket design will be changed to use 623 Bearings in the very near future.... Can you wait?

VERTICAL CARRIAGES:
The Cerberus vertical carriages move up and down the extrusion towers by rolling on 3 cnc machined delrin 'w' rollers per carriage. Each roller consists of a cnc machined delrin cover with two 623 bearing pressed in. The roller rides in the T-Slot of the OpenBeam or Misumi 1515 extrusion. This makes for a very smooth and accurate linear carriage system. Dual 623 V Rollers can be purchased from 3d.grabercars.com


BELT TENSION SYSTEM:
There is no belt tensioning system currently designed into the Pup 170 GT2 Belt Drive Deltabot Printer. The belts are open loop and are tensioned as they are connected. Search Thingiverse for appropriate belt connectors. I will design and upload my own in the near future.
