Cerberus Pup 170 Gt2 is a 3D Delta Robot printer that uses GT2 toothed belts and 16 or 20t pulleys. Features include Magnetic Ball joint rods (Magballs), An aluminum hotend mounting bracket that is hinged and allows the hotend tip to function as the z_probe. Bowden tube direct drive easy-load spring tensioned lever arm extruder. 170mm print surface. 500mm tall with 175mm print height.


You will need to make a set of effector rods 215mm long tip-to-tip with 3/8" ball bearings bonded to the ends. Make your own or these are available from Steve Graber - grabercars@gmail.com.


Notes:

All machined parts required to build Cerberus Pup are now all available for purchase at http://3d.grabercars.com. They are manufactured on a CNC lathe to very tight tolerances.

VERTICAL CARRIAGE DRIVE SYSTEM:
Requires GT2 belts and 20T (or 16T) pulleys. Each upper gt2 belt idler consists of 2x 623 bearings placed side-by-side. 

VERTICAL CARRIAGES:
The Cerberus vertical carriages move up and down the extrusion towers by rolling on 3 cnc machined delrin 'V' rollers per carriage. Each roller consists of a cnc machined delrin cover with two 623 bearing pressed in. The roller rides in the T-Slot of the OpenBeam or Misumi 1515 extrusion. This makes for a very smooth and accurate linear carriage system. Dual 623 V Rollers can be purchased from 3d.grabercars.com - You can use either version of the roller, the Dual 623 WIDE V or the Dual 623 V.


BELT TENSION SYSTEM:
The belts are open loop and are tensioned as they are inserted into the teeth of the Vertical Carriage Bearing Bracket. 


Cerberus Pup 170 is a very quiet printer which can be made even more quiet by use of the Astrosyn NEMA 17 vibration dampers. You will need to print 3x "Lower Outer Bracket-astrosyn_damper.stl" file instead of 3x "Lower Outer Bracket.stl" file.
